# clent-test

    # Write a program to design Vending Machine using your 'favourite language' with all possible tests
        We can execute this in 2 ways
        1) I have written this using Java. We can run the test from main class (VendingMachineTest.java)
        2) I have written some JUNIT tests for the Vending Machine program. Which will run as part of API tests
        
        
     # Running API and JUnit tests from command line
        1) Make sure you have installed maven globally in your machine
        2) once maven installed, you can run all tests using the below command:
           ## mvn clean verify
           
         Once we ran the above command, it will run all tests and generate a serenity report.
         Which will be in the target/site/serenity/index.html
